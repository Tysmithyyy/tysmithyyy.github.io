[link to my portfolio](https://www.smithyyy.dev)

This project is my own portfolio website. It is hosted on Github Pages, and contains some details about my experience, some of my sample projects, and ways to contact me. 

This is a simple static webpage using the Bootstrap CSS framework and basic HTML.
